        <p >I wanted sommething dorky to show how much I love you. You inspire me everyday to be myself. You show me the light that I have in myself something that I hid for many many years. You make me so happy Jackson and I will always love you for that. Throughout our time together I have seen you grow in so many ways. You have changed so much and shifted into the person I am proud to call mine. I know life is scary and full of uncertainties but I know I always hace you and I will always choose you. I hope life will be kinder to the both of us and I will always try to make it kinder to you. I can't believe that I get to see you grow and shine evry day.I can't wait to go into this next year with you and see how you continue to grow. I love that everyday when you come home you give me a kiss and the way that you look at me. I want you to know how much you have changed me into a better partner, a better friend, and a better person. I hope that this year you continue to chase your dreams and continue to find hobbies watching you work in the garden is so cute.
